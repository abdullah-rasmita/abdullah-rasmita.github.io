## Abdullah

I am Abdullah, someone who enjoys understanding how things work — from physical systems and technology to ideas and processes behind them. My background spans engineering and physics, but my interests are not confined to any single field.

I spend much of my time working with experiments, data analysis, models, and simulations, often bridging abstract theory with practical implementation and real-world observations. I am particularly drawn to structured ways of thinking that make complex systems easier to understand, test, and reuse.

This website is a personal space where I collect projects, notes, experiments, and reflections. It may evolve over time — sometimes technical, sometimes exploratory — without being limited to a single theme or purpose.

## Rahmi

Rahmi is someone who enjoys learning about people and the world around them, especially through the lenses of history, children’s education, and psychology. She is interested in how past experiences, environments, and cultures shape the way individuals and families grow.

In her spare time, she likes to read, observe, and reflect on topics related to child development, learning, emotions, and behavior. These interests often come from everyday experiences at home and a curiosity about how small choices and environments influence children over time.

This website is also a personal space for her to collect notes, reflections, and ideas related to education, history, and family life. Like the rest of the site, it is meant to remain open and evolving, without pressure to follow a fixed format or goal.
