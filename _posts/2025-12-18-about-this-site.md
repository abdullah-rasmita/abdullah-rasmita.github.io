## Abdullah
I enjoy understanding how things work — from physical systems and technology to ideas and processes behind them.

I often work with experiments, data analysis, models, and simulations, connecting abstract ideas with practical observation.

This site is a personal space for projects, notes, and reflections, free to evolve over time.

## Rahmi
Rahmi is interested in people and how they grow, with curiosity about history, children’s education, and psychology.

In her spare time, she enjoys reading and reflecting on these topics, inspired by everyday family life.

This website also serves as a place for her notes and reflections, kept personal and open-ended.
