This is a shared personal website by Abdullah and Rahmi.

## Abdullah

I enjoy understanding how things work — from physical systems and technology to ideas and processes behind them. My background is in engineering and physics, but my interests remain broad and exploratory.

I often work with experiments, data analysis, models, and simulations, connecting abstract ideas with practical observation and implementation.

## Rahmi

Rahmi is interested in people and how they grow, with particular curiosity about history, children’s education, and psychology.

In her spare time, she enjoys reading and reflecting on these topics, often inspired by everyday family life.
